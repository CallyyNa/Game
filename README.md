# Fight for the galaxy with my first browser game
This is the first of three projects I created at Ironhack during a 9-week bootcamp to learn Web-Development. 

## What is this game?
This is a game created with the HTML element canvas and JavaScript.
The player is able to move to the right and to the left and shoot with the shift key. The goal of the game to shoot all enemies before they reach your lines.
The Star Wars Theme is a personal interest that I put in there. 

## How it works
The user starts on the first page and reads through how the game works and the backstory of the scenario. 
Right: -->
Left: <--
Shoot: Shift

## Try the game yourself

### Either play here: 
The demo is hosted on GitHub: (https://callyyna.github.io/Game/)

### Or code yourself
Clone the project with this command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/CallyyNa/Game.git
```

Without having to install any dependencies you can just start the application. If you are using Visual Studio Code, I recommend the Live Server extension.
